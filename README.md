dump1090-soapysdr is a ADS-B, Mode S, and Mode 3A/3C demodulator and decoder that
will receive and decode aircraft transponder messages received via
a directly connected software defined radio, or from data provided over a
network connection.

It is based on the [dump1090](https://github.com/flightaware/dump1090) version from FlightAware and inherits most of its features. This version is maintained by [AVIONIX](http://avionix.eu/).

It can provide a display of locally received aircraft data in a terminal or via a browser map.
